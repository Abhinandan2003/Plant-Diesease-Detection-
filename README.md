# Plant Disease Detection System

## Overview

This Plant Disease Detection System is a web-based application built with Flask that allows users to identify plant diseases based on images. The system utilizes a new plant disease dataset obtained from Kaggle, providing accurate and efficient detection of diseases in various plant species.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plants with potential diseases.
- **Disease Identification**: The system processes the uploaded images and identifies the plant diseases using a machine learning model trained on the Kaggle dataset.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Flask website provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Plant Disease Detection System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow (or any other machine learning framework)
- Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhinandan2003/Plant-Diesease-Detection-.git
   cd Plant-Diesease-Detection-
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

run
python app.py
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 by default.

Usage
Access the application through a web browser.

Upload an image of a plant with potential diseases.

The system will process the image and display the identified plant diseases.

Dataset
The system uses a new plant disease dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes images of plants affected by various diseases, providing a diverse set of training data for the machine learning model.

Model Training
The machine learning model used for disease detection is trained on the Kaggle dataset. If you wish to retrain the model or use a different dataset, refer to the train_model.ipynb notebook for guidance.
